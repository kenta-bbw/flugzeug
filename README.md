The purpose of this project is to create a Java program that simulates an airline fleet by creating objects that represent airplanes. The program will use object-oriented programming principles to define an Airplane class, which will have attributes such as the make and model, seating capacity, fuel capacity, and current fuel level.

The program will allow users to create and manipulate Airplane objects, such as filling up the fuel tank, adding or removing passengers, or changing the make and model. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to interact with the Airplane objects and see the changes they make in real-time.

To add further depth to the project, the program could incorporate features such as a database to store information about the airplanes, a GUI to display the airplanes graphically, or the ability to generate reports about the airplanes based on their attributes.

This project will provide a great opportunity for users to practice object-oriented programming principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, the project will require users to think critically about the design of the Airplane class and how it should interact with other parts of the program.

By the end of this project, users should have a better understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, as well as experience in designing and implementing a class that represents a real-world object. They will also have a better understanding of how airplanes work and the factors that affect their performance, such as fuel capacity and passenger load.
